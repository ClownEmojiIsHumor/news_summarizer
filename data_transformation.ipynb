Thai Finance Minister Korn Chatikavanij told CNN the protests have taken between 0.3 percent and 0.5 percent off the nation's gross domestic product so far this year and have had an \\\"incalculable impact on investor confidence.\\\" The protests could shave as much 2 percent of GDP if it continues through the rest of the year. \\\"The longer it lasts, the greater the risk of violence breaking out -- which has proven to be the case,\\\" said Korn. \\\"Once violence breaks out, the potential impact on the economy is all the more greater.\\\" One person died from clashes Friday and two were in critical condition, a local hospital director said. All three were shot. A rebel red shirt leader who was shot Thursday while being interviewed by Western journalists was also in critical condition. On Friday afternoon, government troops were tightening around a protester encampment as shots rang out around the area. The typically bustling downtown area of Bangkok has shuttered its businesses as Red Shirt protesters occupied a 3-kilometer wide area near the business district. The 1,700 shops and 10 hotels in the area are losing an estimated $6 million a day. One in six of Thailand's 61 million citizens live in the Bangkok area. Tourism, which makes up about 6 percent of the Thai economy and employs more than one million people, has been hardest hit by the protests that began in March. Banyan Tree Holdings, which owns several resorts in Thailand, projects that bookings and residential sales will take a hit this year. \\\"Unless there is a resolution to the Thai political situation soon, there is no clear visibility on the Group's performance for the rest of the year,\\\" Chairman Ho KownPing said Thursday in a statement. \\\"Clearly the impact on the economy has been the impact on tourism,\\\" Korn said. \\\"Obviously pictures that are appearing on TV screens across the world has obviously spooked potential tourists. Several governments have issued travel warnings for Thailand as a whole and we've seen bookings disappear at least for the months of June and July.\\\" The government still predicts the Thai economy will grow at least 4.5 percent this year. The World Bank had earlier predicted that Thailand -- the second largest economy in Southeast Asia -- will grow 7 percent this year. Foreign investors had been bullish on the Thai economy. But in recent weeks, the investment tide has turned. Overseas investors shed $130 million in the month of April, according to the Thai Stock Exchange. That sell-off has escalated in the past week as foreign investors sold off $584 million in Thai shares the past six sessions, Reuters reported. Korn said there was little disruption to business outside the immediate vicinity of the protests. \\\"Those who invested in Thailand generally invested in areas outside of Bangkok, and they have been in no way undermined by the ongoing protests ... so from that perspective it's been pretty much business as usual,\\\" Korn said. \\\"That's why the economy has kept humming along for that reason,\\\" Korn said. \\\"But the protests definitely have an impact on confidence and will definitely have an impact on the decision-making process for investors.\\\" CNN's Dan Rivers, Andrew Stevens, Pamela Boykoff and Kevin Voigt contributed to this story .\",\n          \"By .

Ueno-okachimachi Station on the subway in Tokyo, Japan opened in December 2000 . Did the designer of Malostranska station in Prague take inspiration from Dr Who's Tardis? Opened on August 12, 1978 it has only one entrance/exit because of its proximity to the Vitava River . Staromestska station is situated in Prague's old town. Indeed its name means old town. It was opened 36 years ago in 1978 . \\u2018I put this project together because I would like the audience to see their daily commuting underground hubs from a different perspective,\\u2019 he says. \\u2018Personally, the environment truly intrigues me, and through my pictures I want to evoke a sense of drama in the extreme symmetry and contrast that the underground architecture possesses. \\u2018A couple of times, entering the underground made me feel like I was stepping onto a film set.\\u2019 You've seen the entrance to Ueno station in Tokyo - now admire the tracks. Kintetsu Nara Station, Japan was opened in 1914 and has had its present name since 1970. The station consists of four platforms with four tracks . One of Malaysian petroleum engineer Enig Hui's favorite stations - another image of Ueno station in Tokyo . London City Airport station on the Docklands Light Railway which serves London City Airport. It opened on December 2, 2005 and is located on the King George V branch . It was last month when he realised he had amassed a considerable collection of underground images and decided to showcase the series. The engineer has visited around 50 stations around the world including locations such as England, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Czech Republic and Italy. He says: \\u2018It's not difficult to capture the stations and believe it or not I never plan ahead for any underground trip. \\u2018The images were all taken spontaneously during my stay in the cities, while exploring the tourist spots. \\u2018I've had mixed reviews from the public, ranging from eerily empty, creepy or artistically beautiful. \\u2018There are still many cities I would love to visit and capture the underground stations \\u2013 New York, Stockholm, Budapest, Kiev and Lisbon are all on my list.\\u2019 Mind the gap: Bank Station on the London Underground opened in 1884. In a 2013 poll conducted by YouGov, Bank was voted as London's 'Most Disliked' tube station . Euston station in north London  is the sixth busiest railway station in the UK. It was the first inter-city railway station in London, opened on July 20, 1837 as the terminus of the London and Birmingham Railway . Getting a leg up: Wien Westbahnhof railway station is the second largest station in Vienna. It was opened more than 150 years ago in 1858 . Hotel De Ville station, Paris.It is one of the eight original stations opened as part of the first stage of the line between Porte de Vincennes and Porte Maillot on July 19, 1900 . The colourful Karlsplatz station, Vienna . Karlsplatz  - or Charles's Square - station, Vienna - with the escalators looking like any other modern Western European city . A lot better than the name suggests - Rathaus station in the Austrian capital and is on the Vienna U-Bahn. It opened in 1980 . Tottenham Court Road Station in central London. The station opened as part of the Central London Railway on July 30, 1900 .\",\n          \"They may not be able to talk, but babies as young as seven months are able to subconsciously recognise fear in someone\\u2019s eyes, new research claims. Infants can read human expressions by looking at the whites of the eyes - or sclerae - in split seconds. And they seem to react more in response to fear, than happiness, according to the study. Infants can read human expressions by looking at the whites of the eyes - or sclerae \\u2013in split seconds, according to a new study.\\u00a0And they seem to react more (stock image) in response to fear, than happiness . Scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig conducted EEG (electroencephalography) tests, which involved babies wearing a skull cap fitted with electrodes. In the first experiment, 24 babies undergoing the tests were shown images of eyes without any other facial features, either reacting fearfully or showing happiness. The activity in the babies\\u2019 brains changed more in response to fear than happiness. A pair of fearful or surprised eyes (stock image) has larger whites than eyes showing other emotions, such as happiness, when they tend to show the smallest amount of white. The study claims that babies read this cue in just\\u00a050 milliseconds and react to fear stronger than happiness . Sclerae are the whites of human eyes. Experts believe they evolved as a communication aid to allow humans to see where other people were looking, because direction is linked to emotional states. Women\\u2019s brains have more hardwiring than men\\u2019s to read emotions and one consequence is that women have more white in their eyes than men. The study reveals that babies subconsciously recognise fear in someone's eyes by looking at the sclerae for under 50 milliseconds. A pair of fearful or surprised eyes has larger whites than eyes showing other emotions, such as happiness, when they tend to show the smallest amount of white. We are the only primates to have sclerae. For example, apes' are completely dark. Apes' lack of sclerae mean that their prey doesn\\u2019t know where they are looking or whether they have been spotted - giving the creatures a greater chance of hunting success. The same result was seen in a second experiment when 22 babies were shown sclerae when the gaze was direct rather than averted. In each experiment, the images were presented for just 50 milliseconds, which is beyond the threshold of conscious perception, according to the study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. A pair of fearful or surprised eyes has larger whites than eyes showing other emotions, such as happiness, when they tend to show the smallest amount of white. It is thought that the human eye\\u2019s prominent white sclera is important in social interactions. While scientists have previously found evidence for brain mechanisms that allow for the unconscious detection of eye cues in adults, they didn\\u2019t know how early in development this ability emerges - until now. \\u2018The current study provides neural evidence for the unconscious detection of emotion and gaze cues from the sclera in seven month-old infants,\\u2019 said Dr Sarah Jessen, of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences. \\u2018Our findings demonstrate the existence of fast, efficient and reliable social cue detection mechanisms in the human infant brain that likely provide a vital foundation for the development of social interactive skills.\\u2019 Scientists from of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig conducted EEG (electroencephalography) tests, which involved babies wearing a skull cap fitted with electrodes. This stock image shows a four-year-old girl having an EEG test, with her brain activity shown on the screen . Humans are the only primates that have sclerae.

Thai Finance Minister Korn Chatikavanij told CNN the protests have taken between 0.3 percent and 0.5 percent off the nation's gross domestic product so far this year and have had an \\\"incalculable impact on investor confidence.\\\" The protests could shave as much 2 percent of GDP if it continues through the rest of the year. \\\"The longer it lasts, the greater the risk of violence breaking out -- which has proven to be the case,\\\" said Korn. \\\"Once violence breaks out, the potential impact on the economy is all the more greater.\\\" One person died from clashes Friday and two were in critical condition, a local hospital director said. All three were shot. A rebel red shirt leader who was shot Thursday while being interviewed by Western journalists was also in critical condition. On Friday afternoon, government troops were tightening around a protester encampment as shots rang out around the area. The typically bustling downtown area of Bangkok has shuttered its businesses as Red Shirt protesters occupied a 3-kilometer wide area near the business district. The 1,700 shops and 10 hotels in the area are losing an estimated $6 million a day. One in six of Thailand's 61 million citizens live in the Bangkok area. Tourism, which makes up about 6 percent of the Thai economy and employs more than one million people, has been hardest hit by the protests that began in March. Banyan Tree Holdings, which owns several resorts in Thailand, projects that bookings and residential sales will take a hit this year. \\\"Unless there is a resolution to the Thai political situation soon, there is no clear visibility on the Group's performance for the rest of the year,\\\" Chairman Ho KownPing said Thursday in a statement. \\\"Clearly the impact on the economy has been the impact on tourism,\\\" Korn said. \\\"Obviously pictures that are appearing on TV screens across the world has obviously spooked potential tourists. Several governments have issued travel warnings for Thailand as a whole and we've seen bookings disappear at least for the months of June and July.\\\" The government still predicts the Thai economy will grow at least 4.5 percent this year. The World Bank had earlier predicted that Thailand -- the second largest economy in Southeast Asia -- will grow 7 percent this year. Foreign investors had been bullish on the Thai economy. But in recent weeks, the investment tide has turned. Overseas investors shed $130 million in the month of April, according to the Thai Stock Exchange. That sell-off has escalated in the past week as foreign investors sold off $584 million in Thai shares the past six sessions, Reuters reported. Korn said there was little disruption to business outside the immediate vicinity of the protests. \\\"Those who invested in Thailand generally invested in areas outside of Bangkok, and they have been in no way undermined by the ongoing protests ... so from that perspective it's been pretty much business as usual,\\\" Korn said. \\\"That's why the economy has kept humming along for that reason,\\\" Korn said. \\\"But the protests definitely have an impact on confidence and will definitely have an impact on the decision-making process for investors.\\\" CNN's Dan Rivers, Andrew Stevens, Pamela Boykoff and Kevin Voigt contributed to this story .\",\n          \"By . Paul Donnelley . If they are given a second thought at all, it is not for their architecture or beauty but usually how quickly can we get out of them. Enig Hui, a petroleum engineer from Miri, Malaysia, takes a different view. For the last six years he has photographed stations all around the world from Euston to Hotel De Ville station in Paris and Kintetsu Nara Station in Japan. Viennese fancy: Praterstern station, Vienna is used by 35,000 people daily. The first station on the site opened on January 6, 1838. It was damaged by bombs in the Second World War and was demolished in 1965. The new building was opened on June 1, 1959 . Ueno-okachimachi Station on the subway in Tokyo, Japan opened in December 2000 . Did the designer of Malostranska station in Prague take inspiration from Dr Who's Tardis? Opened on August 12, 1978 it has only one entrance/exit because of its proximity to the Vitava River . Staromestska station is situated in Prague's old town. Indeed its name means old town. It was opened 36 years ago in 1978 . \\u2018I put this project together because I would like the audience to see their daily commuting underground hubs from a different perspective,\\u2019 he says. \\u2018Personally, the environment truly intrigues me, and through my pictures I want to evoke a sense of drama in the extreme symmetry and contrast that the underground architecture possesses. \\u2018A couple of times, entering the underground made me feel like I was stepping onto a film set.\\u2019 You've seen the entrance to Ueno station in Tokyo - now admire the tracks. Kintetsu Nara Station, Japan was opened in 1914 and has had its present name since 1970. The station consists of four platforms with four tracks . One of Malaysian petroleum engineer Enig Hui's favorite stations - another image of Ueno station in Tokyo . London City Airport station on the Docklands Light Railway which serves London City Airport. It opened on December 2, 2005 and is located on the King George V branch . It was last month when he realised he had amassed a considerable collection of underground images and decided to showcase the series. The engineer has visited around 50 stations around the world including locations such as England, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Czech Republic and Italy. He says: \\u2018It's not difficult to capture the stations and believe it or not I never plan ahead for any underground trip. \\u2018The images were all taken spontaneously during my stay in the cities, while exploring the tourist spots. \\u2018I've had mixed reviews from the public, ranging from eerily empty, creepy or artistically beautiful. \\u2018There are still many cities I would love to visit and capture the underground stations \\u2013 New York, Stockholm, Budapest, Kiev and Lisbon are all on my list.\\u2019 Mind the gap: Bank Station on the London Underground opened in 1884. In a 2013 poll conducted by YouGov, Bank was voted as London's 'Most Disliked' tube station . Euston station in north London  is the sixth busiest railway station in the UK. It was the first inter-city railway station in London, opened on July 20, 1837 as the terminus of the London and Birmingham Railway . Getting a leg up: Wien Westbahnhof railway station is the second largest station in Vienna. It was opened more than 150 years ago in 1858 .

Infants can read human expressions by looking at the whites of the eyes - or sclerae - in split seconds. And they seem to react more in response to fear, than happiness, according to the study. Infants can read human expressions by looking at the whites of the eyes - or sclerae \\u2013in split seconds, according to a new study.\\u00a0And they seem to react more (stock image) in response to fear, than happiness . Scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig conducted EEG (electroencephalography) tests, which involved babies wearing a skull cap fitted with electrodes. In the first experiment, 24 babies undergoing the tests were shown images of eyes without any other facial features, either reacting fearfully or showing happiness. The activity in the babies\\u2019 brains changed more in response to fear than happiness. A pair of fearful or surprised eyes (stock image) has larger whites than eyes showing other emotions, such as happiness, when they tend to show the smallest amount of white. The study claims that babies read this cue in just\\u00a050 milliseconds and react to fear stronger than happiness . Sclerae are the whites of human eyes. Experts believe they evolved as a communication aid to allow humans to see where other people were looking, because direction is linked to emotional states. Women\\u2019s brains have more hardwiring than men\\u2019s to read emotions and one consequence is that women have more white in their eyes than men. The study reveals that babies subconsciously recognise fear in someone's eyes by looking at the sclerae for under 50 milliseconds. A pair of fearful or surprised eyes has larger whites than eyes showing other emotions, such as happiness, when they tend to show the smallest amount of white. We are the only primates to have sclerae. For example, apes' are completely dark. Apes' lack of sclerae mean that their prey doesn\\u2019t know where they are looking or whether they have been spotted - giving the creatures a greater chance of hunting success. The same result was seen in a second experiment when 22 babies were shown sclerae when the gaze was direct rather than averted. In each experiment, the images were presented for just 50 milliseconds, which is beyond the threshold of conscious perception, according to the study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. A pair of fearful or surprised eyes has larger whites than eyes showing other emotions, such as happiness, when they tend to show the smallest amount of white. It is thought that the human eye\\u2019s prominent white sclera is important in social interactions. While scientists have previously found evidence for brain mechanisms that allow for the unconscious detection of eye cues in adults, they didn\\u2019t know how early in development this ability emerges - until now. \\u2018The current study provides neural evidence for the unconscious detection of emotion and gaze cues from the sclera in seven month-old infants,\\u2019 said Dr Sarah Jessen, of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences. \\u2018Our findings demonstrate the existence of fast, efficient and reliable social cue detection mechanisms in the human infant brain that likely provide a vital foundation for the development of social interactive skills.\\u2019 Scientists from of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig conducted EEG (electroencephalography) tests, which involved babies wearing a skull cap fitted with electrodes.

Thai Finance Minister Korn Chatikavanij told CNN the protests have taken between 0.3 percent and 0.5 percent off the nation's gross domestic product so far this year and have had an \\\"incalculable impact on investor confidence.\\\" The protests could shave as much 2 percent of GDP if it continues through the rest of the year. \\\"The longer it lasts, the greater the risk of violence breaking out -- which has proven to be the case,\\\" said Korn. \\\"Once violence breaks out, the potential impact on the economy is all the more greater.\\\" One person died from clashes Friday and two were in critical condition, a local hospital director said. All three were shot. A rebel red shirt leader who was shot Thursday while being interviewed by Western journalists was also in critical condition. On Friday afternoon, government troops were tightening around a protester encampment as shots rang out around the area. The typically bustling downtown area of Bangkok has shuttered its businesses as Red Shirt protesters occupied a 3-kilometer wide area near the business district. The 1,700 shops and 10 hotels in the area are losing an estimated $6 million a day. One in six of Thailand's 61 million citizens live in the Bangkok area. Tourism, which makes up about 6 percent of the Thai economy and employs more than one million people, has been hardest hit by the protests that began in March. Banyan Tree Holdings, which owns several resorts in Thailand, projects that bookings and residential sales will take a hit this year. \\\"Unless there is a resolution to the Thai political situation soon, there is no clear visibility on the Group's performance for the rest of the year,\\\" Chairman Ho KownPing said Thursday in a statement. \\\"Clearly the impact on the economy has been the impact on tourism,\\\" Korn said. \\\"Obviously pictures that are appearing on TV screens across the world has obviously spooked potential tourists. Several governments have issued travel warnings for Thailand as a whole and we've seen bookings disappear at least for the months of June and July.\\\" The government still predicts the Thai economy will grow at least 4.5 percent this year. The World Bank had earlier predicted that Thailand -- the second largest economy in Southeast Asia -- will grow 7 percent this year. Foreign investors had been bullish on the Thai economy. But in recent weeks, the investment tide has turned. Overseas investors shed $130 million in the month of April, according to the Thai Stock Exchange. That sell-off has escalated in the past week as foreign investors sold off $584 million in Thai shares the past six sessions, Reuters reported. Korn said there was little disruption to business outside the immediate vicinity of the protests. \\\"Those who invested in Thailand generally invested in areas outside of Bangkok, and they have been in no way undermined by the ongoing protests ... so from that perspective it's been pretty much business as usual,\\\" Korn said. \\\"That's why the economy has kept humming along for that reason,\\\" Korn said. \\\"But the protests definitely have an impact on confidence and will definitely have an impact on the decision-making process for investors.\\\" CNN's Dan Rivers, Andrew Stevens, Pamela Boykoff and Kevin Voigt contributed to this story .\",\n          \"By . Paul Donnelley . If they are given a second thought at all, it is not for their architecture or beauty but usually how quickly can we get out of them. Enig Hui, a petroleum engineer from Miri, Malaysia, takes a different view. For the last six years he has photographed stations all around the world from Euston to Hotel De Ville station in Paris and Kintetsu Nara Station in Japan. Viennese fancy: Praterstern station, Vienna is used by 35,000 people daily. The first station on the site opened on January 6, 1838. It was damaged by bombs in the Second World War and was demolished in 1965. The new building was opened on June 1, 1959 . Ueno-okachimachi Station on the subway in Tokyo, Japan opened in December 2000 . Did the designer of Malostranska station in Prague take inspiration from Dr Who's Tardis? Opened on August 12, 1978 it has only one entrance/exit because of its proximity to the Vitava River . Staromestska station is situated in Prague's old town. Indeed its name means old town. It was opened 36 years ago in 1978 . \\u2018I put this project together because I would like the audience to see their daily commuting underground hubs from a different perspective,\\u2019 he says. \\u2018Personally, the environment truly intrigues me, and through my pictures I want to evoke a sense of drama in the extreme symmetry and contrast that the underground architecture possesses. \\u2018A couple of times, entering the underground made me feel like I was stepping onto a film set.\\u2019 You've seen the entrance to Ueno station in Tokyo - now admire the tracks. Kintetsu Nara Station, Japan was opened in 1914 and has had its present name since 1970. The station consists of four platforms with four tracks . One of Malaysian petroleum engineer Enig Hui's favorite stations - another image of Ueno station in Tokyo . London City Airport station on the Docklands Light Railway which serves London City Airport. It opened on December 2, 2005 and is located on the King George V branch . It was last month when he realised he had amassed a considerable collection of underground images and decided to showcase the series. The engineer has visited around 50 stations around the world including locations such as England, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Czech Republic and Italy. He says: \\u2018It's not difficult to capture the stations and believe it or not I never plan ahead for any underground trip. \\u2018The images were all taken spontaneously during my stay in the cities, while exploring the tourist spots. \\u2018I've had mixed reviews from the public, ranging from eerily empty, creepy or artistically beautiful. \\u2018There are still many cities I would love to visit and capture the underground stations \\u2013 New York, Stockholm, Budapest, Kiev and Lisbon are all on my list.\\u2019 Mind the gap: Bank Station on the London Underground opened in 1884. In a 2013 poll conducted by YouGov, Bank was voted as London's 'Most Disliked' tube station . Euston station in north London  is the sixth busiest railway station in the UK. It was the first inter-city railway station in London, opened on July 20, 1837 as the terminus of the London and Birmingham Railway . Getting a leg up: Wien Westbahnhof railway station is the second largest station in Vienna. It was opened more than 150 years ago in 1858 . Hotel De Ville station, Paris.It is one of the eight original stations opened as part of the first stage of the line between Porte de Vincennes and Porte Maillot on July 19, 1900 . The colourful Karlsplatz station, Vienna . Karlsplatz  - or Charles's Square - station, Vienna - with the escalators looking like any other modern Western European city . A lot better than the name suggests - Rathaus station in the Austrian capital and is on the Vienna U-Bahn. It opened in 1980 . Tottenham Court Road Station in central London. The station opened as part of the Central London Railway on July 30, 1900 .\",\n          \"They may not be able to talk, but babies as young as seven months are able to subconsciously recognise fear in someone\\u2019s eyes, new research claims. Infants can read human expressions by looking at the whites of the eyes - or sclerae - in split seconds. And they seem to react more in response to fear, than happiness, according to the study. Infants can read human expressions by looking at the whites of the eyes - or sclerae \\u2013in split seconds, according to a new study.\\u00a0And they seem to react more (stock image) in response to fear, than happiness . Scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig conducted EEG (electroencephalography) tests, which involved babies wearing a skull cap fitted with electrodes. In the first experiment, 24 babies undergoing the tests were shown images of eyes without any other facial features, either reacting fearfully or showing happiness. The activity in the babies\\u2019 brains changed more in response to fear than happiness. A pair of fearful or surprised eyes (stock image) has larger whites than eyes showing other emotions, such as happiness, when they tend to show the smallest amount of white. The study claims that babies read this cue in just\\u00a050 milliseconds and react to fear stronger than happiness . Sclerae are the whites of human eyes. Experts believe they evolved as a communication aid to allow humans to see where other people were looking, because direction is linked to emotional states. Women\\u2019s brains have more hardwiring than men\\u2019s to read emotions and one consequence is that women have more white in their eyes than men. The study reveals that babies subconsciously recognise fear in someone's eyes by looking at the sclerae for under 50 milliseconds. A pair of fearful or surprised eyes has larger whites than eyes showing other emotions, such as happiness, when they tend to show the smallest amount of white. We are the only primates to have sclerae. For example, apes' are completely dark. Apes' lack of sclerae mean that their prey doesn\\u2019t know where they are looking or whether they have been spotted - giving the creatures a greater chance of hunting success. The same result was seen in a second experiment when 22 babies were shown sclerae when the gaze was direct rather than averted. In each experiment, the images were presented for just 50 milliseconds, which is beyond the threshold of conscious perception, according to the study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. A pair of fearful or surprised eyes has larger whites than eyes showing other emotions, such as happiness, when they tend to show the smallest amount of white. It is thought that the human eye\\u2019s prominent white sclera is important in social interactions. While scientists have previously found evidence for brain mechanisms that allow for the unconscious detection of eye cues in adults, they didn\\u2019t know how early in development this ability emerges - until now. \\u2018The current study provides neural evidence for the unconscious detection of emotion and gaze cues from the sclera in seven month-old infants,\\u2019 said Dr Sarah Jessen, of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences. \\u2018Our findings demonstrate the existence of fast, efficient and reliable social cue detection mechanisms in the human infant brain that likely provide a vital foundation for the development of social interactive skills.\\u2019 Scientists from of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig conducted EEG (electroencephalography) tests, which involved babies wearing a skull cap fitted with electrodes. This stock image shows a four-year-old girl having an EEG test, with her brain activity shown on the screen . Humans are the only primates that have sclerae. For example, apes\\u2019 are completely dark. Experts believe that the white of the eye evolved as a communication aid to allow humans to see where other people were looking, because direction is linked to emotional states. Women\\u2019s brains have more hardwiring than men\\u2019s to read emotions and one consequence of this is that women have more white in their eyes than men. While apes may miss out on this extra communication tool, their lack of sclerae mean that their prey doesn\\u2019t know where they are looking or whether they have been spotted - giving the creatures a greater chance of hunting success. Humans are the only primates that have sclerae. For example, apes\\u2019are completely dark.

Thai Finance Minister Korn Chatikavanij told CNN the protests have taken between 0.3 percent and 0.5 percent off the nation's gross domestic product so far this year and have had an \\\"incalculable impact on investor confidence.\\\" The protests could shave as much 2 percent of GDP if it continues through the rest of the year. \\\"The longer it lasts, the greater the risk of violence breaking out -- which has proven to be the case,\\\" said Korn. \\\"Once violence breaks out, the potential impact on the economy is all the more greater.\\\" One person died from clashes Friday and two were in critical condition, a local hospital director said. All three were shot. A rebel red shirt leader who was shot Thursday while being interviewed by Western journalists was also in critical condition. On Friday afternoon, government troops were tightening around a protester encampment as shots rang out around the area. The typically bustling downtown area of Bangkok has shuttered its businesses as Red Shirt protesters occupied a 3-kilometer wide area near the business district. The 1,700 shops and 10 hotels in the area are losing an estimated $6 million a day. One in six of Thailand's 61 million citizens live in the Bangkok area. Tourism, which makes up about 6 percent of the Thai economy and employs more than one million people, has been hardest hit by the protests that began in March. Banyan Tree Holdings, which owns several resorts in Thailand, projects that bookings and residential sales will take a hit this year. \\\"Unless there is a resolution to the Thai political situation soon, there is no clear visibility on the Group's performance for the rest of the year,\\\" Chairman Ho KownPing said Thursday in a statement. \\\"Clearly the impact on the economy has been the impact on tourism,\\\" Korn said. \\\"Obviously pictures that are appearing on TV screens across the world has obviously spooked potential tourists. Several governments have issued travel warnings for Thailand as a whole and we've seen bookings disappear at least for the months of June and July.\\\" The government still predicts the Thai economy will grow at least 4.5 percent this year. The World Bank had earlier predicted that Thailand -- the second largest economy in Southeast Asia -- will grow 7 percent this year. Foreign investors had been bullish on the Thai economy. But in recent weeks, the investment tide has turned. Overseas investors shed $130 million in the month of April, according to the Thai Stock Exchange. That sell-off has escalated in the past week as foreign investors sold off $584 million in Thai shares the past six sessions, Reuters reported. Korn said there was little disruption to business outside the immediate vicinity of the protests. \\\"Those who invested in Thailand generally invested in areas outside of Bangkok, and they have been in no way undermined by the ongoing protests ... so from that perspective it's been pretty much business as usual,\\\" Korn said. \\\"That's why the economy has kept humming along for that reason,\\\" Korn said. \\\"But the protests definitely have an impact on confidence and will definitely have an impact on the decision-making process for investors.\\\" CNN's Dan Rivers, Andrew Stevens, Pamela Boykoff and Kevin Voigt contributed to this story .\",\n          \"By . Paul Donnelley . If they are given a second thought at all, it is not for their architecture or beauty but usually how quickly can we get out of them. Enig Hui, a petroleum engineer from Miri, Malaysia, takes a different view. For the last six years he has photographed stations all around the world from Euston to Hotel De Ville station in Paris and Kintetsu Nara Station in Japan. Viennese fancy: Praterstern station, Vienna is used by 35,000 people daily. The first station on the site opened on January 6, 1838. It was damaged by bombs in the Second World War and was demolished in 1965. The new building was opened on June 1, 1959 . Ueno-okachimachi Station on the subway in Tokyo, Japan opened in December 2000 . Did the designer of Malostranska station in Prague take inspiration from Dr Who's Tardis? Opened on August 12, 1978 it has only one entrance/exit because of its proximity to the Vitava River . Staromestska station is situated in Prague's old town. Indeed its name means old town. It was opened 36 years ago in 1978 . \\u2018I put this project together because I would like the audience to see their daily commuting underground hubs from a different perspective,\\u2019 he says. \\u2018Personally, the environment truly intrigues me, and through my pictures I want to evoke a sense of drama in the extreme symmetry and contrast that the underground architecture possesses. \\u2018A couple of times, entering the underground made me feel like I was stepping onto a film set.\\u2019 You've seen the entrance to Ueno station in Tokyo - now admire the tracks. Kintetsu Nara Station, Japan was opened in 1914 and has had its present name since 1970. The station consists of four platforms with four tracks . One of Malaysian petroleum engineer Enig Hui's favorite stations - another image of Ueno station in Tokyo . London City Airport station on the Docklands Light Railway which serves London City Airport. It opened on December 2, 2005 and is located on the King George V branch . It was last month when he realised he had amassed a considerable collection of underground images and decided to showcase the series. The engineer has visited around 50 stations around the world including locations such as England, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Czech Republic and Italy. He says: \\u2018It's not difficult to capture the stations and believe it or not I never plan ahead for any underground trip. \\u2018The images were all taken spontaneously during my stay in the cities, while exploring the tourist spots. \\u2018I've had mixed reviews from the public, ranging from eerily empty, creepy or artistically beautiful. \\u2018There are still many cities I would love to visit and capture the underground stations \\u2013 New York, Stockholm, Budapest, Kiev and Lisbon are all on my list.\\u2019 Mind the gap: Bank Station on the London Underground opened in 1884. In a 2013 poll conducted by YouGov, Bank was voted as London's 'Most Disliked' tube station . Euston station in north London  is the sixth busiest railway station in the UK. It was the first inter-city railway station in London, opened on July 20, 1837 as the terminus of the London and Birmingham Railway .

Infants can read human expressions by looking at the whites of the eyes - or sclerae - in split seconds. And they seem to react more in response to fear, than happiness, according to the study. Infants can read human expressions by looking at the whites of the eyes - or sclerae \\u2013in split seconds, according to a new study.\\u00a0And they seem to react more (stock image) in response to fear, than happiness . Scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig conducted EEG (electroencephalography) tests, which involved babies wearing a skull cap fitted with electrodes. In the first experiment, 24 babies undergoing the tests were shown images of eyes without any other facial features, either reacting fearfully or showing happiness. The activity in the babies\\u2019 brains changed more in response to fear than happiness. A pair of fearful or surprised eyes (stock image) has larger whites than eyes showing other emotions, such as happiness, when they tend to show the smallest amount of white. The study claims that babies read this cue in just\\u00a050 milliseconds and react to fear stronger than happiness . Sclerae are the whites of human eyes. Experts believe they evolved as a communication aid to allow humans to see where other people were looking, because direction is linked to emotional states. Women\\u2019s brains have more hardwiring than men\\u2019s to read emotions and one consequence is that women have more white in their eyes than men. The study reveals that babies subconsciously recognise fear in someone's eyes by looking at the sclerae for under 50 milliseconds. A pair of fearful or surprised eyes has larger whites than eyes showing other emotions, such as happiness, when they tend to show the smallest amount of white. We are the only primates to have sclerae. For example, apes' are completely dark. Apes' lack of sclerae mean that their prey doesn\\u2019t know where they are looking or whether they have been spotted - giving the creatures a greater chance of hunting success. The same result was seen in a second experiment when 22 babies were shown sclerae when the gaze was direct rather than averted. In each experiment, the images were presented for just 50 milliseconds, which is beyond the threshold of conscious perception, according to the study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. A pair of fearful or surprised eyes has larger whites than eyes showing other emotions, such as happiness, when they tend to show the smallest amount of white. It is thought that the human eye\\u2019s prominent white sclera is important in social interactions. While scientists have previously found evidence for brain mechanisms that allow for the unconscious detection of eye cues in adults, they didn\\u2019t know how early in development this ability emerges - until now. \\u2018The current study provides neural evidence for the unconscious detection of emotion and gaze cues from the sclera in seven month-old infants,\\u2019 said Dr Sarah Jessen, of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences. \\u2018Our findings demonstrate the existence of fast, efficient and reliable social cue detection mechanisms in the human infant brain that likely provide a vital foundation for the development of social interactive skills.\\u2019 Scientists from of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig conducted EEG (electroencephalography) tests, which involved babies wearing a skull cap fitted with electrodes.

The \"generic ballot\" question which asks Americans to choose between an unnamed Democrat and an unnamed Republican in their vote for U.S. House, suggests a shift toward the Democrats nationally, if not in key races in key states. That may be because most Americans, 59%, don't consider the conflict with ISIS to be a war, according to a CNN/ORC poll released Monday. Americans remain unsatisfied with Congress's handling of the situation with ISIS: 60% of Americans said they disapprove, just weeks after members of Congress absconded from Capitol Hill without a vote on military action against ISIS to campaign for reelection in their districts.\n",
